Description: pefile, Portable Executable reader module
        
        All the PE file basic structures are available with their default names as
        attributes of the instance returned.
        
        Processed elements such as the import table are made available with lowercase
        names, to differentiate them from the upper case basic structure names.
        
        pefile has been tested against many edge cases such as corrupted and malformed
        PEs as well as malware, which often attempts to abuse the format way beyond its
        standard use. To the best of my knowledge most of the abuse is handled
        gracefully.
