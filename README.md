# COVID-19 Vaccination Slot Booking Script

This very basic CLI based script can be used to automate covid vaccination slot booking on Co-WIN Platform. 

### Important: 
- POC project. **Use at your own risk**.
- Do NOT use unless all beneficiaries selected are supposed to get the same vaccine and dose. 
- No option to register new users or add beneficiaries. This can be used only after the beneficiary has been added through the official app/site
- **Be careful if you choose to use the auto-book feature.** It will blindly book for the first available center name, date - both sorted ascending - and a RANDOM slot. I would recommend __against__ using this. It is only added for the convenience of people in short supply areas.
- If you accidentally book a slot, don't worry. You can always login to the official portal and cancel that. There will be an X symbol on the right-top corner **_for each beneficiary._**
- API Details (read the first paragraph at least): https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin/cowin-public-v2
- Please feel free to spread the word, if you don't mind. Link: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6794138228464193536/
- And finally, I know code quality isn't excellent. Suggestions are welcome.


### Usage:

Anyone not familiar with Python and using Windows, using the ```covid-vaccine-slot-booking.exe``` "executable file would be the easiest way. It might trigger an anti-virus alert. That's because I used ```pyinstaller``` to package the python code, and it needs a bit more effort to avoid such alerts.

OR

Run the script file as shown below:

```
python src\covid-vaccine-slot-booking.py
```
If you're on Linux, install the beep package before running the Python script. To install beep, run:
```
sudo apt-get install beep
```
If you already have a bearer token, you can also use:
```
python src\covid-vaccine-slot-booking.py --token=YOUR-TOKEN-HERE
```

### Third-Party Package Dependency:
- ```tabulate``` : For displaying data in tabular format.
- ```requests``` : For making GET and POST requests to the API.
- ```inputimeout``` : For creating an input with a timeout.

Install all dependencies by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Steps:
1. Run script:
	```python src\covid-vaccine-slot-booking.py```
2. Select Beneficiaries. Read the important notes. You can select multiple beneficiaries by providing comma-separated index values such as ```1,2``` :
	```
	Enter the registered mobile number: ██████████
	Requesting OTP with mobile number ██████████..  
	Enter OTP: 999999  
	Validating OTP..  
	Token Generated: █████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████  
	Fetching registered beneficiaries..  
	+-------+----------------------------+---------------------------+------------+  
	| idx   | beneficiary_reference_id   | name                      | vaccine    |  
	+=======+============================+===========================+============+  
	| 1     | ██████████████             | █████████████████████████ | COVISHIELD |

	+-------+----------------------------+---------------------------+------------+  
	  
	################# IMPORTANT NOTES #################  
	# 1. While selecting beneficiaries, make sure that selected beneficiaries are all taking the same dose: either first OR second.  
	# Please do no try to club together booking for first dose for one beneficiary and second dose for another beneficiary.  
	#  
	# 2. While selecting beneficiaries, ensure that beneficiaries selected for the second dose take the same vaccine: COVISHIELD OR COVAXIN.  
	# Please do no try to club together booking for beneficiary taking COVISHIELD with beneficiary taking COVAXIN.  
	###################################################  
	  
	Enter comma-separated index numbers of beneficiaries to book for: 2
	```


3. Ensure correct beneficiaries are getting selected:
	```
	Selected beneficiaries:  
	+-------+----------------------------+-----------+  
	| idx   | beneficiary_reference_id   | vaccine   |  
	+=======+============================+===========+  
	| 1     | ██████████████             |           |  
	+-------+----------------------------+-----------+
	```

4. Select a state
	```
	+-------+-----------------------------+  
	| idx   | state                       |  
	+=======+=============================+

	+-------+-----------------------------+
	```
	```
	Enter State index: 18
	```
5. Select districts you are interested in. Multiple districts can be selected by providing comma-separated index values
	```
	+-------+--------------------+  
	| idx   | district           |  
	+=======+====================+  
	| 1     | Alappuzha          |  
	+-------+--------------------+  
	| 2     | Ernakulam          |  
	+-------+--------------------+  
	| 3     | Idukki             |  
	+-------+--------------------+
	+-------+--------------------+

	| 13    | Thrissur           |  
	+-------+--------------------+  
	| 14    | Wayanad            |  
	+-------+--------------------+
	```
	```
	Enter comma-separated index numbers of districts to monitor: 2,13
	```
6. Ensure correct districts are getting selected.
	```
	Selected districts:  
	+-------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------------+  
	| idx   | district_id   | district_name   | district_alert_freq   |  
	+=======+===============+=================+=======================+  
	| 1     | 307           | Ernakulam       | 660                   |  
	+-------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------------+  
	| 2     | 303           | Thrissur        | 3080                  |  
	+-------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------------+
	```
7. Enter the minimum number of slots to be available at the center:
	```
	Filter out centers with availability less than: 5
	```
8. Script will now start to monitor slots in these districts every 15 seconds.
	```
	===================================================================================  
	Centers available in Ernakulam from 01-05-2021 as of 2021-04-30 15:13:44: 0  
	Centers available in Thrissur from 01-05-2021 as of 2021-04-30 15:13:44: 0  
	No viable options. Wait for the next update in 15s.
	===================================================================================  
	Centers available in Ernakulam from 01-05-2021 as of 2021-04-30 15:13:59: 0  
	Centers available in Thrissur from 01-05-2021 as of 2021-04-30 15:13:59: 0  
	No viable options. Wait for the next update in 15s.
	```
9. If at any stage your token becomes invalid, the script will make a beep and prompt for ```y```  "or ```n``` . If you'd like to continue, provide ```y```  "and proceed to allow using the same mobile number
	```
	Token is INVALID.  
	Try for a new Token? (y/n): y
	Try for OTP with mobile number ███████████? (y/n) : y
	Enter OTP: 888888
	```  
11. When a center with more than a minimum number of slots is available, the script will make a beep sound - different frequencies for different districts. It will then display the available options as a table:
	```
	===================================================================================  
	Centers available in Ernakulam from 01-05-2021 as of 2021-04-30 15:34:19: 1  
	Centers available in Thrissur from 01-05-2021 as of 2021-04-30 15:34:19: 0  
	+-------+----------------+------------+-------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+  
	| idx   | name           | district   | available   | date       | slots                                                                        |  
	+=======+================+============+=============+============+==============================================================================+  
	| 1     | Ayyampilly PHC | Ernakulam  | 30          | 01-05-2021 | ['09:00AM-10:00AM', '10:00AM-11:00AM', '11:00AM-12:00PM', '12:00PM-02:00PM'] |  
	+-------+----------------+------------+-------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+  
	---------->  Wait 10 seconds for updated options OR  
	---------->  Enter a choice e.g: 1.4 for (1st center 4th slot): 1.3
	```
12. Before the next update, you'll have 10 seconds to provide a choice in the format ```centerIndex.slotIndex``` eg: The input```1.4``` "will select the vaccination center in the second row and its fourth slot.
